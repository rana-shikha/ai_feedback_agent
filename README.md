# Project Title: Customer Feedback Analyzer
# Project Description:  
Customer Feedback Analyzer helps clients analyze their customer feedback effectively. As a data analysis agent, it focuses on various aspects to provide a comprehensive understanding of customer feedback. It performs sentiment analysis to determine if the feedback is positive, negative, or neutral. Through qualitative analysis, we identify key themes and patterns, while quantitative analysis helps us extract trends and statistics from numerical data. Additionally, it detects recurring themes to find common issues in multiple feedback entries and prioritize the most important issues based on their impact and frequency. This thorough approach enables clients to make data-driven decisions to enhance their services and products.
# Technologies Used:
To build the Customer Feedback Analyzer, we used services from Supabase and AWS, with Python.
- Supabase Services:
    - Database and API: We used the Supabase API to manage and interact with supabase database.
- AWS Services:
    - AWS Bedrock: We used the Cloud 3 Sonet agent from AWS Bedrock for advanced natural language processing tasks, including sentiment analysis and theme identification.
    - Amazon SageMaker: We developed our solution on Amazon SageMaker.
    - AWS Lambda: We used AWS Lambda to run our Python code in a serverless environment.
